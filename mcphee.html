		<h1>Encounters with the Archdruid: Contrasting Brower and Fraser</h1>
		<p>Over the course of “An Island,” Charles Fraser is portrayed as a complexly unique figure amid the sea of capitalism. He is not motivated solely by money, but rather by his 
		intertwined goals of beauty and absolute control, and his foundational premise is the necessity of carefully regulated development that leaves some natural areas intact. These 
		qualities make Fraser seem much more environmentally conscious than is typical in a profit driven industry. However, the final section of the essay plays a critical function in 
		revealing flaws in Fraser’s stance, and through this complicates the relationship between man and the natural world. </p>											
		<p>The last section begins by renewing the portrayal of Brower as a religious figure. McPhee notes that Brower “performed his matins” rather than simply reading, and some of the articles are 
		described as “heretical,” as if they violate a religious dogma (144, 145). “An Island” begins by establishing Brower’s evangelical zeal, but this is followed by remarkably subdued protest to 
		Fraser’s plans for development. The resurgence of this characterization is therefore notable, as it shows that Brower’s strong stance has not been swayed by Fraser’s presentation of his plans. 
		Brower’s devotion to preservation is still forceful enough to merit religious comparisons. This suggests that the reader too should resist the persuasion of Fraser’s appeals.</p>
		<p>Brower’s reading material is described in detail in a scene which may easily appear tangential, but is in fact used to create a point of comparison between Fraser and Brower. Both men maintain 
		hefty reading lists that reflect their worldviews. Fraser reads about facilitating development, such as sewage disposal and company stock, while Brower pursues articles that urge the reduction of 
		development, including arguments against the supersonic transport plane and the Alaska pipeline. Despite Fraser’s value of environmental beauty, his pile of literature reminds the reader that “his 
		conversation is predominantly about money – its flows, its freezes, its cataracts, its sources, its deltas” (89). While Fraser was not originally motivated by monetary greed, it is now an almost 
		tangible part of his world in the same way that actual rivers are foundational to Brower. The depiction of money as a river shows that for Fraser, the environment and economic interest are now tightly 
		connected. This revelation is complicated by Brower’s statement that the business world is “at last finding out that the environment is not only to sell” followed immediately by the appearance of 
		Fraser “dressed in a dark suit and tie,” the implication being that Fraser is one of those individuals who ascribe more than monetary value to the natural world (146). Fraser has an innate appreciation 
		for aesthetics and precise control, and does truly seem to value nature for its beauty. Still, these values simultaneously instigate his entitled belief that in reshaping the environment he bestows 
		improvements upon it. This, combined with his awareness that undeveloped land offers the potential for enormous monetary gain, makes it difficult for the reader to fully support Fraser’s motives.</p>
		<p>In Fraser’s absence, a new tour of the island is conducted by Sam Candler, in which “details came into focus that, at Fraser’s speed, had previously tended to blur” (146). The group stops to eat 
		wild grapefruit and find arrowheads, specialized knowledge that is the fruit of Candler’s observations from a lifetime on the island. Deer walk by rather than fleeing. Nothing could be more different 
		from Fraser’s earlier headlong rush across the island, characterized by violent diction such as “smacked” and “explosive” (105). Fraser’s style of travel reflected his entitled treatment of the island,
		too absorbed in his vision to evaluate the damage he inflicted in merely passing through it. McPhee points out a jetty that no longer reaches the ocean, recalling the conversation about the movement 
		of the dunes and Fraser’s plans to prevent nature from changing in ways that he deems unfavorable. His ideas seem newly laughable with the uselessness of the old jetty as a reminder of the ultimate 
		impermanence of manmade constructs in the context of the natural world.</p>    						
		<p>Despite the comparably gentle nature of Candler as a guide, he too embodies attitudes of entitlement towards nature. He recalls playing with “muzzled alligators” who surely weren’t thrilled to be 
		his personal toys, and industry infringes upon his communion with nature in the form of Coca-Cola paraphernalia (147). In the established debate of man versus nature, no sides are without problematic 
		aspects. Still, McPhee presents attunement to detail as paramount in making responsible environmental choices, and this can be consistently observed in Brower’s character. For example, he is constantly 
		examining the play of light and shadow. While on the beach, there is a “sonic boom” which connects to earlier references to the SST that Brower opposed. When the birds all rise “flapping in panic” at 
		the sound it is Brower who “staggered as if he had been shot” because he is so highly attuned to the reactions of the natural world (147). This loud but distant noise reminds the reader of the inevitable 
		infringement of man on the natural world even from afar. Because of this, it is essential to listen to those individuals like Brower who maintain a strong sense of environmental connectivity.</p>
