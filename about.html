			<h2>Code Projects</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://students.washington.edu/shl7/capstone/diseaseprofile.html" target="_blank">IHME Disease Profiles</a> were created for the University of Washington Informatics capstone class. The project was sponsored by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research center that provides publicly 
			accessible population health data. This tool will assist health policy makers, advocates, non-governmental organizations, and members of the general public in making informed decisions about public health 
			in regards to funding, policy, and education. 
			The project was implemented using MySQL, PHP, jQuery, and D3.js. 
			The students who worked on this project are Sarah Loftis (front-end developer), Sarah Park (back-end developer), Seung Lee (project manager), and Saralyn Santos (designer). </p>
			<p> <a href="https://srloftis.com/college-finder/" target="_blank">College Finder</a> and <a href="https://srloftis.com/mtg-tutor/" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering Tutor</a> were created for INFX 562: Interactive Information Visualization at the University of Washington. College Finder is intended to support college application decision making for high school students. 
			Many different factors go into deciding which colleges to apply to, including location, cost, and competitiveness. However, students rarely get to see this information presented for all colleges side by side, which makes comparing colleges difficult. 
			This visualization allows students to view all colleges and filter them by the criteria that they care most about. College Finder was implemented using D3.js.<p>
			<p>MTG Tutor is an interactive online tool targeted at people who have never played Magic: The Gathering but want to learn more about the game. Magic: The Gathering is a complex trading card game that is difficult to learn how to play. 
			Many new players learn best by actually playing, but the main online resources for learning how to play are static articles. Completing this explorable explanation takes about ten minutes and 
			leaves the user with an understanding of the basic rules of the game. MTG Tutor is the first highly interactive online resource for new players who want to learn how to play Magic: The Gathering. MTG Tutor was implemented using jQuery.</p>
