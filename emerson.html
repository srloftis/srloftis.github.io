		<h1>Expanding Circles: Understanding Emerson’s metaphor through Hawthorne's lens</h1>
		<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson writes in his essay <a href="https://www.emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/circles/" target="_blank">“Circles”</a> that “around every circle another can be drawn.” He describes life as a perpetual expansion of circles in pursuit of the truth. While Emerson’s implication that the destruction of the old contributes to constant progress is problematic, the metaphor itself is sound. The use of duality in Hawthorne’s “My Kinsman Major Molineux” reveals a new way of understanding Emerson’s metaphor of circles. Through Hawthorne, we can see that the newer circle is larger, not because it is better, but simply because it contains both old and new. The old is not destroyed by the new. It may be mutated, contradicted, and subverted, but not destroyed. Hawthorne’s portrayal of duality reveals that two seemingly contradictory things can coexist to illuminate a fuller truth. Old and new exist together within our circles of understanding. </p>
		<p>In “Circles,” Emerson uses the metaphor of circles to describe the way that new knowledge expands our view of the world, revealing open space where before we perceived impassable boundaries. He writes that “The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and that without end.” Each person begins with a very small picture of the world. At the beginning of our lives we cannot help being ignorant. But as we experience, learn, and create, our perception can expand without limit. However, Emerson also notes that “our life is an apprenticeship to the truth.” The word “apprenticeship” here is key. We are apprentices our entire lives; we do not ever become masters of the truth. Our ability to draw new circles is infinite, but the number of circles that can be drawn is also infinite. </p>
		<p>Emerson makes two problematic claims in expounding the implications of his metaphor of expanding circles. The first problem is the idea that the old is destroyed by the new. He describes old creations “all melted away, as if it had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or fragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow left in cold dells and mountain clefts, in June and July. . . New arts destroy the old.” This metaphor of the old as ice highlights the process of disintegration, and represents the new as a replacement for the old rather than as an addition. The second problem is that Emerson implies that each new circle brings us closer to a state of perfection. He writes, “In the thought of to-morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures, of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted.” In this statement, Emerson compares the expanding circles of the future to heaven. This connotes a kind of divine plan guiding us into the new. It also implies that each change we make is an improvement and pushes us inevitably into a better world. The root of these two problems is the either-or mentality and lack of complexity in the notion that new replaces old, and a better future will completely replace the problems of the past. </p>
		<p>Hawthorne’s <a href="http://www.hawthorneinsalem.org/mirror_eldritch/mm.html" target="_blank">“My Kinsman, Major Molineux”</a> contains the insight needed to make Emerson’s metaphor of circles ring true. The story is characterized by a well-crafted revealing of duality that illuminates the complicated nature of the American Revolution. Hawthorne’s story exposes the cruelty underlying many of the acts carried out in the name of the revolution at a time when it was popularly glorified. The focal point of the story is the moment of eye contact between an older man who is being publicly tortured and humiliated, and his young kinsman who has looked up to him. Rather than delving into the political goals of the revolution, the story delivers the emotional weight of the cruelty that accompanied it. In this way, Hawthorne reminds the reader that the revolution cannot be simplified into a heroified version of events. </p>
		<p>Hawthorne creates a sense of duality throughout “My Kinsman, Major Molineux.” Many familiar objects take on characteristics that are the opposite of their common associations. The instruments in the parade emit a “tuneless bray, the antipodes of music.” What can be used to play beautiful music is easily bastardized into a cacophony. The torches held by the rioters follow the same pattern, as “a dense multitude of torches shone along the street, concealing, by their glare, whatever object they illuminated” and “the unsteady brightness of the latter formed a veil which he could not penetrate.”  Here, light conceals the surroundings rather than illuminating the scene as we would expect. </p>
		<p>This duality extends to the characters as well. The reader is repeatedly told that Robin is “a shrewd youth,” and yet he can’t figure out why everyone keeps laughing at him until the answer is literally staring him in the face when the procession passes by his seat on the church steps. He may have been astute in the familiarity of the countryside, but when he ventures into a new setting his reliance on past assumptions blinds him to the reality of the situation. Sometimes Robin may be shrewd, but at other times he is an unwitting fool. To characterize him as immutably only one of these, as is done by both the narrator and Robin himself, creates a dissonance between description and reality. He cannot be simplified into one defining characteristic. These observations of character are tied together when the man waiting with Robin says, "May not a man have several voices, Robin, as well as two complexions?" Within one person can exist a multitude of qualities that taken individually may seem to be completely opposite, but together are united into the complex truth of an individual. In each of these examples, Hawthorne takes a person or object and reveals that it contains another, seemingly opposite, dimension. These smaller instances of duality build an understanding that everything has more than one side, and reiterate the larger idea of the multifaceted nature of the American Revolution. </p>
		<p>When we realize that Robin isn’t always shrewd, or that light doesn’t only illuminate, that doesn’t cause us to completely reject those characteristics. Instead, we hold both light and dark, old and new in our minds to form a more nuanced understanding. Here, we see can that contradictory to Emerson’s claim, the new does not destroy the old. If the relationship between old and new were as simple as new replacing old, a more appropriate metaphor would be repeatedly drawing a darker, more obstinate circle of exactly the same size along the circumference of the circle we already had. The new by itself is not a guarantee of progress. It is only one more perspective. Instead, progress is made when old and new coexist, with the knowledge of multiple perspectives helping us gain a deeper understanding of the world. </p>
		<p>While Emerson draws problematic conclusions in “Circles,” the underlying metaphor of circles itself is not flawed. There is always more to learn, and different facets to examine. Some new ideas will become ubiquitous, while others remain obscure. But even for new ideas that do feel like progress and become widely used, we don’t forget their past origins. As shown in Hawthorne’s “My Kinsman, Major Molineux,” we need to know more about something than its current appearance to truly understand it. A light that shines may also conceal, and a revolution that is portrayed as glorious may also be cruel. Old and new perspectives work together to expand our circles in the pursuit of truth.  </p>
