		<h1>A Comparison of Lynn Emanuel and Richard Hugo: “Who is She Kidding,” “Duwamish,” and “Driving Montana”</h1>
		<p>American poets Lynn Emanuel and Richard Hugo are the authors of numerous works centered in the western United States as well as in Italy. Emanuel’s poem “Who is She Kidding” and Hugo’s poems “Duwamish” and “Driving Montana” complicate the relationship between reader and speaker through their narrative patterns. The poems of Emanuel and Hugo grapple with the barriers inherent in language and its inability to allow us to fully share our experiences with others. The poems acknowledge a constant struggle against the inadequacy of language, and in the very act of recognizing and carrying out the struggle, are successful in abating some of its shortcomings.</p>
		<p>In “Who is She Kidding,” Emanuel’s speaker reflects on her past experiences and travels. In doing so, the speaker acknowledges the complexity that is created by a constant stream of experience, saying “you can’t fit a girl like that / into the straitjacket of a book of poems” (Emanuel 10-11). The image of poetry as a straightjacket may seem surprising coming from a poet, but hits upon an important point that despite the ability of language to describe, it is also restricted and in some ways confining. The speaker elaborates, saying, “I mean no book of poems in the world / is big enough to explain how she got / from Ely, Nevada, to Talamone” (Emanuel 12-14). Even for a poet, there isn’t a way to fully communicate all of the events and influences and emotions that led her across the world. Instead, “she just moves along as though / poetry were an interstate and here we are / passing Ely, here we are copulating / with Marco” (Emanuel 15-18). The new image of poetry as an interstate is juxtaposed against the earlier straightjacket; the first was a cage while the second propels her forward. The repetition of “here we are” brings the reader suddenly into each new place, without explanation, and indeed “all the little stitches / of explaining have been cut” (Emanuel 18-19). Explanations sew all of the pieces neatly together, but there is also a freedom in cutting open and abandoning the straitjacket attempt to make language conform exactly to reality. Because of the impossibility of perfectly replicating the journey for the reader, the speaker uses poetry to convey emotional truth rather than carefully recounting each detail.</p>   
		<p>While “Who is She Kidding” engages with the passing of time, “Duwamish” pivots off a single experience of Hugo’s first person speaker observing the Duwamish River. The first three stanzas describe the river vividly, noting how the ubiquity of industry has muted the bright colors of nature. In the fourth stanza however, there is a shift in focus to the speaker, and this marks a corresponding shift in diction. The speaker repeats “cold” over and over, seeming to get stuck on the word. The speaker tries to describe the specific kind of cold feeling in a progression of similes:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“I come here to be cold. Not silver cold</br>

			like ice, for ice has glitter. Gray</br>

			cold like the river. Cold like 4 P.M.</br>

			on Sunday. Cold like a decaying porgy” </br> (Hugo 34-37).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Once the focus is on the speaker rather than the setting, he flounders, feeling unable to adequately convey his feelings. The speaker moves from simile to simile, each continuation giving the impression that the last was insufficient, an incomplete description requiring something more. He describes “looking for a word” (Hugo 29), seeking the right way to phrase his thoughts as if they are a physical object that he’ll be able to find somewhere along the river. Moving into the fifth stanza is another shift, as the speaker opens with “But cold is a word” (Hugo 38). Beginning with “but” sets the speaker up to refute everything he just labored in trying to convey, and in reducing cold to just “a word” he seems to be recognizing a degree of futility in the previous stanza. The speaker elaborates on his realization of the inadequacy of language with the statement that “There is no word along / this river I can understand or say. Not Greek threats to a fishless moon / nor Slavic chants. All words are Indian” (Hugo 39-40). The shortcomings of language are universal, rooted in the nature of language itself rather than specific to any one language.</p>
		<p>Another Hugo poem, “Driving Montana,” recounts the experience of driving through Montana for a day. The poem instills an uncertainty regarding how the subject got from one place to the next and the events that constituted the journey, shown through repeated questioning:</p>
		<blockquote><p>
		“Where did you stop along the road</br>

		and have fun? Was there a runaway horse?</br>

		Did you park at that house, the one</br>

		alone in a void of grain, white with green</br>

		trim and red fence, where you know you lived</br>

		once?” (Hugo 13-18).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>This questioning retelling of events reflects the incompatibility of constructed time with the fluidity of the road trip that the speaker is lost in, and the inability of language to reconcile the two.</p>
		<p>In the three poems, second person narration complicates the relationship between poet and reader, and diminishes the barriers in sharing experiences through language. The speaker “I” in Emanuel’s poem “Who is She Kidding” addresses “you/honey” and also references an unidentified “she” and “we.” The unnamed “she” seems to be a past version of the speaker herself, although this is only apparent based on context from other poems. By using a third person pronoun, the speaker creates a divide between her past self and the “I” of the present, exploring the desire to disconnect from the past and be seen as whole without these experiences. At the same time, the speaker occasionally refers to her past and present selves as a collective “we,” such as when she recounts that “here we are / passing Ely, here we are copulating / with Marco” (Emanuel 16 – 18). “We” simultaneously connects and distances; the use of a plural pronoun implies that there are multiple, separate people, but also categorizes them together as a cohesive whole. The speaker recognizes that her different personas and experiences across the passage of time are essential to herself, even when they seem irreconcilably different or undesirable. Because the members of “we” are not clarified, it also has the effect of drawing the reader into the group to experience the memories along with the speaker. Furthermore, the speaker addresses a “you” that is left unspecified, allowing the reader to take on that role. And the “you” is treated not as an unfamiliar observer, but is familiarly called “honey.” The narrative structure itself reflects the idea that poetry is both an interstate and a straightjacket, bringing together and dividing and constraining all at once. In this way the reader becomes involved as far more than a disparate observer, requiring a questioning of one’s own past and present selves.</p>
		<p>While “Who is She Kidding” is formed around this multitude of pronouns, the first half of “Duwamish” reads like a third person narration. The speaker remains in the background, unannounced until the fourth stanza, in which the poem’s focus moves away from the setting and onto the speaker. The new acknowledgement of “I” marks a shift inward, moving from large to small. Part of this transition comes in addressing the reader, as the poem moves into second person narration with “just before you came” (Hugo 23). Unlike the continuous references to “you” in “Who is She Kidding,” this is the only time it is used in “Duwamish.” The speaker then says “I come here” (Hugo 34), diction which ties the “you” and “I” together to connect the speaker and reader similarly to Emanuel’s “we.” This one tenuous link is the single instance of connecting pronouns in the poem, and yet it is enough to invoke the image of reader and speaker both sharing the experience of coming to the river. The solidarity of the shared action allows the reader to fill in his or her own melancholy gray reasons for going to the river, which opens the door for much more emotional truth than the reader trying to exactly replicate an imagined version of the cold that the speaker feels.</p>
		<p>Contrastingly, “Driving Montana” utilizes consistent second person narration throughout. There is no “I” – the poem instead retells the experiences of an unidentified “you” that the reader can easily step into. However, because the narrator is so familiar with the experiences, and describes them as if the listener is not, it becomes unclear who these experiences actually belong to. The speaker knows all the thoughts and places that were the pieces of that road trip – that you were in “Silesia at nine” (Hugo 12), and that “you remembered the ringing creek” (Hugo 18). But how does the speaker know what “you” felt and remembered? This blurring of roles draws the speaker and reader very closely together. Although “you are lost / in miles of land without people, without / one fear of being found” (Hugo 24-26), the reader feels the constant presence of the speaker sharing in the journey. The familiarity with “your” experiences creates an incredibly strong connection.  </p>
		<p>The poems of Hugo and Emanuel deal with persistent themes regarding language itself, and the ways in which we use it to try to create textual and interpersonal connections. Through the effective use of pronouns, the poems are able to surmount some of the divisions inherent in language and convey emotional truth that connects the speaker and reader.</p>
