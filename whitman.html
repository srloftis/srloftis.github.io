		<h1>Expectations of Gender in Whitman’s “The Sleepers”</h1>
		<p>In <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/sleepers" target="_blank">“The Sleepers,”</a> Walt Whitman challenges dominant gender stereotypes by creating parallels between male and female characters. However, while Whitman portrays men taking on female traits, he does not allow women access to traditionally male characteristics. In doing so, Whitman perpetuates traditional expectations of women. Despite this, the text’s strong motifs of unity and diversity create an undercurrent that carries the reader through the flaws in his portrayal of women. Ultimately, the reader is left with a sense that gender roles are mutable and loosely defined.</p>
		<p>Throughout “The Sleepers,” Whitman’s use of repetition draws parallels between male and female to create a sense of commonality between the two. Whitman describes how “The married couple sleep calmly in their bed—he with his palm on the hip of the wife, and / she with her palm on the hip of the husband,” using the same phrasing to describe both sleepers. Rather than placing the man and woman in different postures or emphasizing their distinguishing features, Whitman simply repeats the same description for each gender. Similarly, Whitman notes the “The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed, / The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,” again using a repeated structure to describe both male and female sleepers. This instance of repetition more boldly draws the genders together. The adverb “lovingly” is used first to describe the women and is notably retained in the description of the men. As women are generally stereotyped as emotional, describing them as sleeping “lovingly” isn’t surprising, especially between sisters. However, men are traditionally expected to be much less emotional, and a portrait of men sleeping “lovingly” together demands the reader’s attention, even more so when they have not been identified as brothers. In creating this parallel, Whitman seems to be suggesting that traits that are traditionally considered to be feminine are equally applicable to men. Whitman again turns our attention to emotion in describing “The female that loves unrequited sleeps, / And the male that loves unrequited sleeps.” Again, the repeated structure of the two descriptions creates an additional layer of unity between male and female. The two sleepers are in the same situation, experiencing the same emotions, and the fact that one is a man and the other is a woman doesn’t change that. This builds the idea that our experience of the world is not defined by our gender.</p>
		<p>Whitman reiterates the feminine side of masculinity through his portrayal of George Washington. He is shown on the battlefield, where “he cannot repress the weeping drops.” The image of a national hero crying in public is striking in its unconventionality. We are taught that crying is feminine and weak, but even Washington “cannot repress” it. His inability to stifle emotion shows that this so-called feminine quality is deeply rooted in who he is as a man. Washington is also shown among his officers, as he “encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the cheek, / He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another.” Light kisses and embraces are actions that have clear feminine connotations, as expressions of gentle affection. Additionally, their “wet cheeks” imply that his men have also been crying. This feminized description of Washington and his men is notable because unlike the previous images linking masculinity to femininity, here there is no female figure being paralleled. There are only men in the scene. Furthermore, the context is not domestic, where the display of emotion would be more traditionally acceptable, but of battle, which is a traditionally male sphere. Whitman allows Washington and his officers to be feminine in the company of other men. Crafting the scene in this way makes it clear that Washington and his men cannot be dismissed as somehow feminine by association; they are not taking on these characteristics to navigate a female space, but in fact claim emotion as part of their own identities as men. </p>
		<p>Alongside these passages that link masculinity to feminine characteristics, Whitman also places images of traditional gender roles. One that especially stands out is the swimmer struggling for his survival. Whitman notes his “courageous arms” and “undaunted eyes,” and even in death he is a “brave corpse.” The scene celebrates his bravery, determination, and physical strength. Despite the doomed nature of his struggle, the swimmer does not show any fear or despair. These qualities of physical prowess and mental fortitude define the standard of what it means to be manly. It’s hard not to wonder how Whitman may have written this scene differently with a female swimmer. Would her struggle, too, be characterized by her strength and resolve? This brings up a key observation of Whitman’s treatment of gender in the text. While men are shown to encompass both their expected masculine traits as well as traditionally feminine qualities, women are not granted the same access to both sides of the spectrum. Women are confined to traditional female roles, and are valued for their traditionally feminine characteristics. We see that “the mother sleeps, with her little child carefully wrapt,” a conventional image of maternity. The mother dutifully attends her child, while the father is permitted to be elsewhere. Later, the speaker assumes the role of an old woman, saying “It is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old woman’s, / I sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn my grandson’s stockings.” Blurring the line between the speaker and the old woman is a form of empathy that reveals the fluidity of identity. This suggests that gender is not a barrier in understanding the experiences of others. Still, we again see a woman placed in a very traditional role, this time darning stockings, and again the woman is described as accomplishing her tasks “carefully.” This diction connotes a certain restriction on the women’s actions and conveys the sense that everything must be done just so. Women are expected to act in a way that is small and contained, without any wildness or recklessness.</p> 
		<p>The description of the “red squaw” that the speaker’s mother encountered comes closer to breaking from these expectations, but does not quite succeed. The speaker notes that “her step was free and elastic,” with this freedom contrasting against the restricted quality of the previous women’s actions. However, this freedom seems to be driven more by exoticization of the “red squaw” than by a desire to represent women more complexly. The speaker notes that “Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity.” To her, the squaw is completely foreign and unlike other women. The mother “look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger,” suggesting that she sees the squaw as a kind of curiosity more than a fellow woman. In this way, the freedom of the squaw functions more to represent her as an unknowable other than to expand the characterization of women’s roles. Women as pure, nurturing, maternal - these are the images of women that Whitman draws upon. It’s hard to believe that Whitman’s speaker can fully empathize with female identities when presented with such a limited pool of characteristics. It’s not that these characterizations are inaccurate, just extremely incomplete. Whitman’s men are fearless and sensitive, strong and gentle. The overarching motifs of unity and diversity in the text would be much more compelling if similar complexity were given to the women he writes. </p>
		<p>Still, the idea of unity is an undeniably strong presence in the text, and works to reduce the negative impact created by the flawed portrayal of women. Sleeps acts as a kind of equalizer, an experience shared by everyone regardless of gender, race, economic status, or any other perceived divisions. In the phrase “all, all sleep,” the repetition of “all” really drives this point across. Despite our differences, some experiences are universal. Not only that, but the speaker states, “I swear they are averaged now—one is no better than the other, / The night and sleep have liken’d them and restored them.” For Whitman, these commonalities make it clear that there is no true social hierarchy. We are far more alike than different. However, he does not intend this to act as an erasure of flaws, and calls people what they are, whether it’s a prisoner, murderer, or idiot. At the time, the speaker notes, “I swear they are all beautiful; / Every one that sleeps is beautiful—everything in the dim light is beautiful.” Beauty, like sleep, is somehow universal. There is a sense of unified ebb and flow, of the reconciliation of flaws, of a lack of separation between apparent opposites, that together create a very strong sense of unity in the text. We see “the homeward bound, and the outward bound,” and the speakers who states “I know I came well, and shall go well.” The repetition of coming and going create a sense of fluid, unified motion between two opposite actions. Finally, the poem ends with “I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes; / I will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly return to you,” marking the transition from night to day and back to night. This represents the passage of time as cyclical rather than linear. Again, there is no rigid distinction between states, only a fluid, unified beauty.</p>
		<p>In “The Sleepers,” Whitman challenges, but does not erase, traditional expectations of gender. His incomplete portrayal of women means that the text does not reject existing gender roles. The reader is left with a sense that gender roles are fluid, but still very present. Although women do not take on traditional masculine characteristics, the overarching sense of unity in the text creates a sense of connection between the genders that challenges the concept of two distinct sets of characteristics defined by gender.</p>
