		<h1>The Sublime Mountain </h1>
		<p><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/coleridge/645/" target="_blank">“Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement”</a> by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and 
		“The Poet Dreams of the Mountain” by Mary Oliver are both first person accounts of a narrator’s 
		journey up a mountain. In both poems, the narrator experiences the sublime through the vastness 
		of the mountain. In “Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement,” the sublime is a single 
		experience from which the narrator departs. This portrayal of the sublime aligns with Edmund Burke’s 
		commentary in “A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and 
		Beautiful,” where the sublime is defined in part by the effect it inspires in a human observer. The 
		sublime is human centric, and valued because it elevates the human. “The Poet Dreams of the 
		Mountain” challenges this idea of the sublime by first portraying the sublime as a continuous 
		experience, and then presenting a sublime image without a human observer. Both of these serve 
		to decentralize the role of the human in the sublime.    </p>
		<p>In “A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful,” 
		Burke presents the sublime as composed of two different elements: the effect it inspires in the 
		observer, as well as the characteristics of the sublime object itself. To begin defining the first 
		element, the sublime causes a state in which “the mind is so entirely filled with its object, that it 
		cannot entertain any other” (Burke 57). The sublime originates with pain and danger. Burke 
		notes that pain and danger are “simply painful when their causes immediately affect us; they are 
		delightful when we have an idea of pain and danger, without actually being in such 
		circumstances . . . whatever excites this delight, I call sublime” (Burke 51). The sublime causes 
		astonishment in the human observer, and at lower levels instead causes feelings such as awe and 
		reverence. In each of these descriptions, the sublime is defined by the effect that it creates upon a 
		human observer. Burke also pinpoints a number of qualities that characterize the sublime object, 
		such as power, obscurity, vastness, infinity, and magnificence. These qualities are grounded in 
		the sublime object itself, and their existence is independent of any human observer. However, the 
		criteria for selecting these qualities is still based on the way in which people respond to them. 
		For example, objects of great dimension are sublime because “if but one point is observed at 
		once, the eye must traverse the vast space of such bodies with great quickness, and consequently 
		the fine nerves and muscles destined to the motion of that part must be very much strained; and 
		their great sensibility must make them highly affected by this straining” (Burke 137). This means 
		that for Burke, a thing is sublime because of the effect it has on human observers. If the effect it 
		produced were to change, even if the thing itself remained constant, it would no longer be 
		sublime. </p>   
		<p>In “Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement,” the sublime is portrayed as a 
		single moment of experience. The narrator begins by describing the time he spent at his cottage, 
		which was “low,” “pretty,” and “little.” These are characteristics of the beautiful rather than the 
		sublime. Burke writes, “it is the small we are inclined to be fond of . . . beautiful objects are 
		comparatively small” (Burke 114). While the first stanza is dedicated to establishing the cottage 
		as a place of beauty, the second stanza marks a shift to the sublime. Coleridge begins the second 
		stanza with “but,” signaling that this stanza will be in direct contrast with the preceding stanza. 
		This contrast is further established with the lines “when first / From that low dell, steep up the 
		stony mount I climbed.” The narrator specifies that this is his “first” time going up the mountain; 
		it is a new experience that is unlike anything he has undertaken before. Additionally, these lines 
		highlight the upwards nature of his movement, away from the “low” cottage. Each word used to 
		describe his journey – “steep,” “up,” “mount,” “climbed” – holds an image of upwards motion. 
		This diction is essential in establishing the mountain as a place that is directly contrasted against 
		the cottage. </p> 
		<p>The narrator also notes the “perilous toil” required to reach the top of the mountain. This 
		ties into Burke’s idea that the sublime is caused by the idea of pain and danger. The narrator does 
		not befall any harm in the end, but the steepness of the mountain and its stony slopes impart a 
		sense of possible danger to the climb that contributes to the sublime experience. From the top of 
		the mountain, the narrator looks down and sees the river,  </p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>“And seats, and lawns, the Abbey and the wood,  </br>
		And cots, and hamlets, and faint city-spire;   </br>
		The Channel there, the Islands and white sails, </br> 
		Dim coasts, and cloud-like hills, and shoreless Ocean – ”  </br></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>all spreading out below him. The list structure emphasizes the immense quantity of how much 
		the narrator can see, starting with smaller lawns and ending with the vast ocean. The dash after 
		ocean is particularly interesting, as if everything the narrator sees cannot be contained in the 
		poem. He feels the “omnipresence” of God in all that he sees. The climax occurs when the 
		narrator feels that “No wish profaned my overwhelmed heart. / Blest hour! It was a luxury,– to 
		be!” The state of being overwhelmed recalls Burke’s notion that those experiencing the sublime 
		are completely transfixed by one object and cannot hold any other ideas during this moment. The 
		narrator also describes the moment as “blest,” with the religious connotation again invoking the 
		presence of God. Finally, the phrase “to be” is offset and emphasized as an exclamation. This 
		particular attention to the simple act of existence shows that the sublime heightens one’s 
		awareness and appreciation of self. The sublime is presented as a way to elevate the human 
		through a sense of unity with the vastness of the landscape and God. Immediately after the 
		climax, the narrator states that he must leave the mountain. He feels that it is his duty to serve 
		others during life, and since he cannot do this while alone on a mountain he will return to 
		society. In this way the sublime is portrayed as blissful, but also to some degree indulgent and 
		selfish. The sublime is defined by the human experience of it.   
		<p>In “The Poet Dreams of the Mountain” by Mary Oliver, the sublime is portrayed as an 
		ongoing experience. The narrator describes how she wants to climb the mountain “slowly, taking 
		the rest of my life to do it.” The idea of slowness is repeated throughout the poem. Unlike the 
		experience of Coleridge’s narrator, here the sublime is not characterized as one climatic moment. 
		This narrator does not climb the mountain and move on. Instead, the narrator hopes to engage in 
		a continual experience that will last her lifetime. Coleridge’s sublime is based on a unity between 
		man and landscape that extends the land’s quality of vastness to man. However, Oliver’s narrator 
		implies a divide between human and nature. She notices “How silent the trees, their poetry being 
		of themselves only.” This contrasts with the poetry of the narrator, the poet who dreams of the 
		mountain; her poetry is of mountains and stars and trees and not of herself only. While humans 
		seek a connection to nature, nature is impartial.  </p>
		<p>Because of this, the idea of unity between human and nature is much more complex than 
		is characterized in the euphoric experience of Coleridge’s narrator. The poem ends with the 
		speculation that “in ten thousand years, maybe, a piece of the mountain will fall.” In ten 
		thousand years, the narrator certainly won’t be around to watch. Perhaps no one will see. 
		However, this image of a fall from a great height is still arguably the most sublime moment of 
		the poem, recalling Burke’s comments about finding the sublime in vast vertical expanses. 
		Because of this, the sublime seems independent of human observation. The narrator can 
		experience the sublime by climbing the vast mountain, but the sublime will also continue after 
		she is gone. Rather than finding a perfect unity between human and nature, where the human 
		feels larger as a result, here the human figure remains small. Still, the lack of complete unity 
		does not mean that there is no connection between human and nature. On the contrary, the 
		narrator’s expressed desires to observe and contemplate the mountain for a lifetime indicate that 
		she feels a quite strong connection. However, it is the connection of a smaller piece 
		acknowledging a larger whole, perceiving the vastness of the sublime without claiming vastness 
		for herself.  </p>
		<p>For Coleridge’s narrator, the sublime is a single moment that centers around the human 
		experience. For Oliver’s narrator, the sublime is an extended presence to which the human is not 
		centrally important. In “Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement,” the narrator feels that 
		he has become vast through the sublime experience. The emphasis is on the human reaction to 
		the sublime, and the sublime is a vehicle for the individual to gain a sense of power. In “The Poet 
		Dreams of the Mountain,” the narrator recognizes the vast but does not become it. The sublime is 
		a separate, constant other that exists independently of human observation. The emphasis is on the 
		magnitude of the sublime object itself, and the individual does not gain power or importance by 
		experiencing the sublime. The narrator acknowledges that she is small in comparison to all that is 
		around her.  </p>
